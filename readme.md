# Max's Disc Burning Utility

this tool currently utilizes iTunes library exports to allow you to burn songs/playlists/albums from your itunes library to a cd from the command line. I needed this interface because my only computer with a cd burner is a headless linux box. 
# TODO
before I add more functionality I need to upstream and figure out the (libpytunes)[https://github.com/liamks/libpytunes] and see if they will accept my PR. 

then I want to clean up the UI, right now I am just throwing windows at the layout and I think this is bad. (I know this is bad)

next I would like to add a music player so that you can make sure the songs are correct before burning - maybe even after converting to WAV?
